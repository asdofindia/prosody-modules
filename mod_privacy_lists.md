# Introduction #

Privacy lists are a flexible method for blocking communications.

Originally known as _mod`_`privacy_ and bundled with Prosody, this module is being phased out in favour of the newer simpler blocking (XEP-0191) protocol, implemented in mod\_blocklist.

# Configuration #

None. Each user can specify their privacy lists using their client (if it supports XEP-0016).
