# Introduction #

This module implements stanza archives using files, similar to the default "internal" storage.

# Details #

Refer to [Prosodys data storage documentation](https://prosody.im/doc/storage).

Note that this module does not implement the "keyval" storage method and
can't be used anything other than archives, eg MAM and MUC logs.
